A commitment to not only educating but serving diverse communities is central to the mission of all academic institutions. In spite of this, we have historically failed to live up to this ideal. Hostile learning environments, lack of role models, and systematic barriers continue to make students, particularly underrepresented students, feel as if though they do not belong in our community. As a queer woman of color, I have witnessed firsthand how universities can both support or fail to include students. **It is our responsibility, as those who hold power within academic communities, to advocate for the creation and support of inclusive, accessible spaces for all students, faculty, and staff.** While at Cornell, I have engaged in a variety of service, professional development, and outreach-related activities in support of this goal.
