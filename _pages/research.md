A foundational question in evolutionary biology is the origin and maintenance of distinct species. New species form when a progenitor species is first partitioned such that gene flow between the two subgroups is limited. These subgroups accumulate distinct genetic differences over time both in response to their environement and as a consequenc of genetic drift that build up morphological or behavioral barriers between these groups. These barriers lead to reproductive isolation, the final step in the speciation process.


**My research interests focus on exploring the genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to speciation by integrating population genetic theory and computer simulations that model historic processes with large-scale datasets containing whole-genome and -transcriptome information for populations of interest.**
