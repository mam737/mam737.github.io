As an aspiring facutly member, my mission as an eductor is to disseminate knowledge, teach specific skills, and prepare students for their future careers. To do this, my teaching philosophy can be summarized into three foundational pillars: (1) **clarity** of learning objectives and assessments, (2) **communication** of concepts to diverse audiences, and (3) **empower** students to solve new problems. More details can be found within my [teaching statement] (/assets/teaching_statement.pdf).
